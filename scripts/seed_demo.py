"""Seed the Trading Journal AI database with realistic synthetic data.

Creates backend/trading_journal.db through the app's own schema (database.py),
so the seed can never drift from what the app expects. Everything is generated
from a fixed date and a seeded RNG, so the output is reproducible.

All data produced here is synthetic. No real trades, accounts, or people.

For development and screenshots only. A normal install is always empty.

Usage:
    python scripts/seed_demo.py                 # refuses if a database already exists
